# Tweet Feeed 4.x

## Advanced Twitter Data Management and Display in Drupal

### INTRODUCTION

---

The Tweet Feed module is an advanced importing, displaying and data association tool that allows you to pull in tweets by search criteria, user timeline, or user curated list. The parameters and limits of what is pulled in falls under the guidelines of Twitter's REST API.

Tweets and Twitter Profiles are stored as their own entities but can be displayed via Views and any other contributed module that hooks into the entity API. All hash tags and user mentions are stored as references in the ewntities to their corresponding taxonomy term. This gives you great power in terms of displaying tweets with specific content in specific places by leveraging the power of contextual filters and taxonomies.

To install this module and it's corresponding dependencies, you will use composer:

composer require drupal/tweet_feed
